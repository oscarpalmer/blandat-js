# Blandat

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/blandat-js.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/blandat-js)

A collection of JavaScript goodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;:pizza:

## Setup

Blandat is on [npm](//www.npmjs.com/package/blandat-js) and [yarn](//yarnpkg.com/en/package/blandat-js), but it's just as easy to simply grab the file you want from the [dist-folder](dist) and include it in your project.

## Scripts

- __[Knuff](dist/knuff.min.js)__  
`pushstate` and `popstate`-events, but without the &ldquo;hassle&rdquo;.
- __[Smoothie](dist/smoothie.min.js)__  
for smoothly scrolling to elements on a page.

## Older browsers

These scripts uses a few things introduced in later versions of [ECMAScript](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript), so if you're unsure of what may or may not be supported, I'd recommend using the files compiled by [Babel](//babeljs.io) instead; these files follow the format of `script.babel.js`, like [`smoothie.babel.js`](dist/smoothie/babel.js).

## To do?

:cyclone:&nbsp;&nbsp;Tests  
:books:&nbsp;&nbsp;Proper documentation

## License

[MIT Licensed](LICENSE). You're free to do whatever you'd like with these scripts. Have fun!&nbsp;&nbsp;:blush:
